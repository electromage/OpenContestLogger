# OpenContestLogger

## Description
OpenContestLogger is intended to provide a free and easy way for clubs running any number of transmitters to log contacts for contests such as Field Day.

## Goals
Provide software that is always free to use, easy to set up, safe, and robust

## Features
* Packaged in a way that is easy to get up and running (Docker, Flatpak?)
* Cross-platform (at least for clients - contest inverface via web browser)
* No internet access required (once the software is deployed, any PC on a LAN should have full functionality)
* Robust database backend
* Export logs in correct format for contests without manual toil
